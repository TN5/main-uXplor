# uXplor

uXplor is a mobile-centered web application that allows users to participate in a scavenger hunt through the city. TN5, the creators of uXplor, came up with idea after considering the difficulties of moving to a new place. TN5 wanted to create an app that helps people explore and become familiar with their new city. Users can easily specify the types of locations that they would like to scavenge and a radius to explore; they can also collect badges from locations to view later.

JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL were used to create uXplor. TN5 utilized the Materialize CSS framework to design the application and they also created some basic CSS animations for added fun. The Google Places API was used in the creation of uXplor. Each member of uXplor worked on both the front-end of the code and the back-end. While following stories was an integral part of the workflow, each member also spent considerable amounts of time on various chores.
